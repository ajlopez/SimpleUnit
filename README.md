# SimpleUnit

Simple test framework for JavaScript/Node.js

## Installation

Via npm on Node:

```
npm install simpleunit
```

or globally

```
npm install simpleunit -g
```

## Usage

```
simpleunit <name> [<name> ... ] [-r | --recursive]
```
where `name` is a directory or a `.js` file. If `name` is a directory, it processes all the `.js` files in
directory.

The options `-r`, `--recursive` indicates to process all directories in the tree. Without this option, if a directory is specified,
only the files in the directory are processed, without processing the files in subdirectories.

Each `.js` is a module that exports functions receiving a parameter, ie `test`:

```
exports['one function'] = function (test) {
    test.ok(1);
};

exports['another function'] = function (test) {
    test.ok(1);
};
```

The `test` argument has all the functions available for builtin `assert`.

Reference in your program:

```js
var sf = require('simpleunit');
```
